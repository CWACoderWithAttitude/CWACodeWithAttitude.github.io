I like to code for my mindorms robot. Either with the standard LabView based interface or python.  
Then i found out about you could use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).  
It requires you to install [Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/ev3) to connect your Mindstorms Brick to Scratch.  
After installing Scratch Link head over to the [Scratch editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=ev3)  
Install the EV3 plugin and ready you are.   
Bear in Mind: the Legp Mindstorms EV3 HomeEdition software has to be closed for Scratch to detect your brick.   

Currently i've a problem with the distance sensor not working properly. At least not when used together with the motor control. I found [GitHub Issue #1363](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/issues/1363). But that says the problem has already been solved. I'll do so further investigation and will report the outcome.
