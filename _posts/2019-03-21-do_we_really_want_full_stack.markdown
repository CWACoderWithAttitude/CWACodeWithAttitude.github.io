I'm a bit confused why so many people claim they want Full Stack Developers.


Lets try to find out what a "Full Stack Developer" actually is:
[Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/6-essential-tips-on-how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer-1d10965aaead) says this:

---
A full stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients. Depending on the project, what customers need may be a mobile stack, a Web stack, or a native application stack.

[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp):

(WTF: they have a definition of [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack_js.asp) )

A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.

In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:

Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)

I'm pretty sure there're many descriptions like the two i list here.

Well, this sounds like the hunt for the holy-grail: A human one-stop-shop to solve all your developing probl.. - eh - challenges.

During the time of my professional career i've seen some companies or teams or individuals trying to be "Full Stack".

Lets put it like that: The results were not what you'd expect to see.

I've seen devs who where capable of coding full stack. Guess what - they considerd their work on offer to make to the real experts.
