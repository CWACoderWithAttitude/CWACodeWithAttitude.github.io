# Collection of keyboard shortcuts i consider handy

Although i think those shortcuts are important to know my brain tends to bury this knowledge.

## SSH

When my ssh session hangs due to lost conection the whole terminal is unusable.
Try typing `ENTER + ~ + .` to kill the ssh session (or whatever blocks te terminal)

## OS X 

|Shortcut| Purpose |
|---|---|
|Ctrl + Arrow up | Show all windows on current screen|
|Ctrl + Arrow left| Switch to the left screen| 
|Ctrl + Arrow right| Switch to the right screen| 
|Ctrl + Arrow down| Show all windows of the focused application| <-- very handy|
